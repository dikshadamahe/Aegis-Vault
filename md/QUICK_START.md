## 🔐 How Encryption Works

### When You Add a Password:
1. Browser generates random 16-byte salt
2. Derives encryption key from your passphrase + salt (Argon2id)
3. Encrypts password with libsodium (AES-256-GCM equivalent)
4. Sends **only ciphertext** to server
5. Server stores encrypted data (never sees plaintext)

### When You View a Password:
1. Fetch encrypted data from server
2. Click "Show Password" on card
3. Browser asks for passphrase (if not in memory)
4. Derives key from passphrase + stored salt
5. Decrypts client-side
6. Shows password (never leaves your browser decrypted)

**Your passphrase never leaves the browser. The server never sees plaintext passwords.**

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Server not responding"
- Restart: `npm run dev`
- Check port 3000 is free
- Check `.env.local` has `MONGODB_URI`

### "No categories in dropdown"
- Click folder icon (⚙️)
- Click "Add Default Categories"
- Or manually add categories

### "Passphrase prompt keeps appearing"
- Normal after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Security feature (clears from memory)
- Enter once per session

### "Password not decrypting"
- Ensure you're using the same passphrase you used when creating it
- Passphrase is case-sensitive
- If lost, password is unrecoverable (by design)
